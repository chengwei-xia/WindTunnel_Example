Wind Tunnel Experiment for Ahmed Body Drag Reduction using Active Flow Control by Reinforcement Learning
====================================================================

This is a documentation example about experimental setup and progress note of the Ahmed body flow control experiment in the wind tunnel at Imperial College London.

- **PXI-PC Communication and Data Acquisition**: A UDP-based communication is used for transfering data between a PXI DAQ system and a host PC
- **Labview-Python Interaction Design**: Labview codes were developed for data acquisition and Python codes were used to implement reinforcement learning
- **RL Algorithm**: The RL Algorithm is provided by StableBaselines 3 and StableBaselines 3 contrib
